# Alpha 16: The Comeback Update (3/28/2025)
Didn't expect the update to come so quick, did ya'? It hasn't even been a month since Alpha 15.6!
The development processing is changing, and updates will be coming out much more frequently, just like the old days. No more year-long waits!
Just because this update came out quickly doesn't mean we skimped out on content...

# Alpha 15: The Champion Update (2/3/2025)
Every major update has been the best yet, and Alpha 15 is no exception!
Building off of Alpha 14's heavy overhauls, this update focuses on adding a massive amount of content that redefines the standard.

Telluria Castle Town is the hub of the world.
Buy insanely powerful equipment, upgrade (almost) everything, discover new mechanics, etc... you can do anything and everything in the capital!

Outside those walls, super-powerful enemies lurk within a variety of places.
They'll be a challenge at first, but with so many new ways to strengthen your party, you'll never have a shortage of ways to progress.

I hope you all feel the power as you progress through Telluria Field! But will you be able to defeat the ultimate threat...?

### Changes
- Recapped the max level from level 20 to level 25.
- Random encounters are now blocked in a 6-tile radius around any visible enemy encounter.
- Lots of dialogues were shortened. Many cutscenes were reworked, and a few were even removed.
- Replaced Player 2's 2nd magic equip slot with an offhand slot (light shields).
- Retrying battles is now free, and you have the option to give up. This will return you to the last safe place you rested at; however, this will cost you half of your bits.
- Time now moves indoors.
- Shops are now open 24/7.
- Vehicles can travel under bridges.
- Resprited all existing icons from 24px to 32px. Changed icons of many existing items in the process.
- Overhauled the equip comparison menu.
- The pub/tavern has been rebranded as The Tipsy Oyster! Barkeep's name has been revealed to be Jeremy, and all of his establishments have been redesigned (except for the original in Haven Harbor).
- Revamped Jeremy and Kevin's side quest chains.
- Fleshed out the salvaging system, making many items throughout the game now salvageable.
- Leveling up will also remove all debuffs.
- Renamed most items with stars in their name to make them easier to differentiate.
- Events can now walk through followers. As a result, followers have been enabled in dungeons again.
- Most shop stocks and enemy drop pools have been rebalanced, modified, and standardized.
- Rebalanced mining drops to be much more generous.
- Greatly reduced respawn timers of most respawnables (e.g. oreleaf, flowers).
- Being defeated by a Lost Soul in the Great Pyramid will now send you back to the start of the dungeon instead of giving a game over.
- Many food-related items have been made renewable, and as a result are no longer sold by Dalia.
- The new Speedster Boots have replaced the spot in boot progression once held by the Hermes Boots. The Hermes Boots have been moved up to be crafted near the end of Telluria Field's progression.
- Solus Town now automatically becomes snowy during the holiday season. Presents now have a 50% drop chance on December 25th rather than the default 20%.
- Countless (and I mean COUNTLESS) other small changes have been made throughout the game (probably more than Alpha 14).
- A huge amount of backend reworks/changes have been made to improve performance, consistency, and development efficiency. This is the main reason this update took so long to come out!

### Item/Equipment Balancing
- Nerfed the recovery of the Potion, Elixir, and Ether.
  - Potion: +90 HP → +60 HP
  - Elixir: +36 MP → +24 MP
  - Ether: +108 HP → +72 HP; +42 MP → +30 MP
  - Small Ether and Ether are cheaper. They no longer require bits to craft.
- Reworked Well Fed to make the buff more enticing and encourage cooking.
  - Ration: Reduced from Well Fed to Somewhat Well Fed.
  - Fulfilling Ration, Loaf of Bread: Reduced from Very Well Fed to Well Fed.
  - Fruitcake: Increased from Very Well Fed to Exquisitely Well Fed.
  - All levels of Well Fed last for 3x as many steps (50 → 150, 100 → 300, 150 → 450).
  - All levels of Well Fed now increase ATK and MAT by +2%, +4%, +6%, and +8% at their respective levels.
- Buffed most weapons from the Blazing Sands to make them viable against new content. Dropping 10,000 Bits on new equipment shouldn't be a necessity!
- Buffed tavern potion stat increases from 15% to 25% and turn duration from 10 turns to 15 turns.
- Buffed the Knight's Greaves' DEF by 1 and AGI by 2, and also gave them +0.5% EVA and +0.5% CRI to be able to compete with the Leather Boots.
- Reworked most early-game weapons to not be completely useless.
- Reworked the Water Elemental's Flow. It now provides a 15% increase to outgoing magical damage, but it increases all MP costs by 30%.
- Reworked Blood-Red Headband to grant +1% PLS and +3 AGI rather than +4% MHP and +3% CRI. Its price has increased from 80B to 120B.
- Reworked the Gold Ring. Now the Ring of Shadows, it provides resistance to dark damage.
- Nerfed The Warden's Trade-off from [-10% MDR, +10% PDR] to [-5% MDR, +20% PDR].
- Nerfed the Giant Goblin's Rage's ATK increase from +20% to +10%.
- Gave Bloodlust's base version +2% PLS.

### Skill Balancing
- Many skills had their learn levels and associated party member shuffled around:
  - Magic Resistance/Proneness: P2 15 → P1 16
  - Hold the Line II: 15 → 25
  - Cut Down: 11 → Any Axe
  - Fire II: 17 → 15
  - Lightning II: 19 → 20
  - Earth Power I: 18 → 23
  - Channel Divinity I: 11 → 5
  - Purify: 5 → 8
  - Offensive Stance: 12 → 5
  - Shield Break: P1 16 → P4 18
  - Sharpen Dagger: 3 → Any Dagger
  - Several skills were removed entirely.
- Using BP with Revival now increases success rate (used to increase the amount of HP recovered on a successful revive).
- Backstab can no longer miss.
- Buffed Double Slash's ATK multiplier from 400% x2 to 500% x2. MP cost lowered from 7 to 6.
- Lowered Ice I's MP cost from 5 to 4.
- Nerfed Focused Slash's ATK multiplier from 600% to 500%.
- Reworked Analyze. It now reveals all enemy weaknesses and allows you to see enemy HP (and shields!) for the duration of the battle.
- Buffed Cut Down's DEF penetration from 50% to 100%. Now applies Broken Armor, reducing DEF by 50% for 2 turns.
- Buffed Critical Heal I's max effectiveness from +10% to +50%. However, it will only begin kicking in at 50% HP.

### Miscellaneous Balancing
- Nerfed the critical hit damage formula.
  - Original: 2.0 * (Math.max(1.0, user.int / 40));
  - New:      1.0 + user.int / 40;
- Elements have been heavily revamped. Some of the major changes include:
  - Less standardization so each element has unique behaviors instead of being cookie-cutter.
  - Elemental states no longer apply the damage rates and resistances of their element.
  - Most enemies no longer absorb their element.
- You can no longer equip more than one of the same accessory on a single party member.
- Made a lot of mechanics based around rare enemies less grindy.
  - Doubled the base chance of encountering a rare enemy.
  - As rare enemy spawns fail, the spawn chance will increase exponentially, being reset once a rare enemy finally spawns.
  - Buffed the drop chance of rare enemy accessories from 1/3 to 100%.
  - The Albino Rat and Strange Goblin have been rebalanced to be around the same difficulty as the Rainbow Slime.
- Buffed the drop rate of all resistance accessories from 2% to 5%.
- State resistance accessories no longer remove already applied states when equipped.
- All party members now gain +1 INT per 5 levels, for a total of +20 INT at level 100.
- Skill mastery's effect is 1.5x what it was previously, meaning damage can be increased up to +30% and MP cost can be decreased down to -30%.
- Status effects that provide MHP/MMP no longer reduce HP/MP after wearing off.
- Henry can now be defeated without entering his second phase; however, he now enters his second phase at 40% HP instead of 30%.
- Reduced every level up EXP requirement by 20, making it much easier to level up in the early-game.
- Greatly increased the acceleration of the EXP curve at later levels. Barely affects the game now with such a low level cap, but will help prevent leveling up from becoming trivial in the late/end-game.
- Doubled Well Rested's step duration from 500 to 1000.
- Reworked the Lost Soul (in a very cool way).
- Nerfed the Rogue class's base HIT, EVA, and CRI by 1% each.
- Nerfed the Bat across the board. It was overwhelmingly powerful against new players in the Blazing Sands, wiping unprepared parties with ease.
- Bit drops are higher from almost every source.
- Increased Player 1's base MHP at levels 1 and 2 from [40, 48] to [48, 54], making Green Slime Cavern even easier for new players and reducing the chance of dying to the Mini Green Slime.
- Many other small balance changes have been made to equipment/item stats, prices, crafting recipes, enemy stats/drops, and more.

### Bug Fixes
- Black bars in fullscreen; game should now scale properly to any window size.
- Softlock caused by pushing a boulder in Laeryidyean's Forest off the boulder tiles.
- States intended to be removed by walking would occasionally never expire.
- Accidentally select a downed party member for a support skill (e.g. Cure I) would automatically pick a new target instead of failing.
- Buttons for attack/skills would randomly grey out during battle and be unusuable.
- Battle events triggering during actions. Endings of boss battles will now flow much more smoothly.
- Items reset using the Cleansing Scroll wouldn't save.
- Conditional drops did not work correctly (e.g. night boosted enemies did not properly increase their item drop rate).
- The critical hit chance formula wasn't programmed correctly, making critical evasion basically useless.
- Elemental normal attacks wouldn't remove elemental states.
- The loot explosion after defeating an enemy sometimes did not show the correct drops.
- Party members would sometimes not gain BP between the 1st and 2nd turn of a battle.
- Purify couldn't be used outside of battle.
- Retrying a battle would cause items from previous attempts to show up on the dropped item window at the end of battle. This was only a visual bug.
- The color of a party member's name would not update based on their HP during battle.
- The active quest window would disappear while the event interpreter was running.
- Brawl Brew and Warding Swig would not bypass death removal.
- On Fire!'s damage at the end of every turn was half of the intended value.
- States with no overlay would still override states with an overlay if they had a higher priority value.
- Life steal attributes with decimals would not be parsed correctly.
- The playtime stat wouldn't increase correctly on non-60hz displays.
- The crafted weapons/armor counters could become very wrong.
- Elemental weapons did not count as physical-element hits.
- INT slightly affected state application rates.
- Flashbang could leave an enemy at 0 HP but it wouldn't die until another action was made.
- Exiting the keyboard config menu would fade the options menu back in instead directly cutting to it.
- Magic skills used the wrong motion when casting.
- Battlers affected by Frozen I would still have their sprite move if an action sequence commanded them to.
- Issues #9 and #10.
- Just like usual, a massive amount of minor bugs, textual errors, and visual issues were corrected in this release, many of these thanks to a ton of backend reworks/changes.

### Final Words

Alpha 15 truly defines what The Trail is about. This is the update I've dreamed about making since the beginning, and it's finally here. Honestly hard to believe...

This update was also really important from a development standpoint.
A lot of our philosophies and styles have morphed with experience, and we're always aiming to make playing the game as enjoyable as possible.

With all the bug fixes and improvements to the engine, development should be less of a hassle from now on. Keep an eye out for Alpha 16!

Until then... the journey continues.

Yours truly,
Andrew

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.7 (1/1/2022)
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fighting the Giant Goblin after being sent by the Village Chief would completely lock a save's progression, essentially ruining the file.
This bug will be fixed in saves already affected by it, as long as old save patching is enabled.
Additionally, the snow over Solus Town has melted.
Oh, and happy new year, everyone!

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.6 (12/22/2021)
Fixed a game-breaking bug where fresh downloads of the game would immediately crash upon attempting to save.

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.5 (12/21/2021)
This is a very technical update, mainly serving to continue improving the gameplay experience and make a few small QoL changes.

### Additions
- Added actual descriptions to vanity items. They will show the set they are a part of, as well as a short summary of what the outfit looks like.
- Re-added the category separators on the options menu. Additionally, 2 new options were added:
  - Disable Old Save Patching: Disables the automatic patching of old saves when updating.
  - Equipping Item Stays on Equip Window: When enabled, equipping an item will not return to the equipment slots window.
- Added new information to the save menu.
  - Each save now shows its native version, which is updated every time it is saved in a different version. Pre-vA.14.5 saves or saves missing their version info will display as an unknown version.
  - Saves will also show the time that they were last saved, adjusted for the user's time zone. The time since the last save is also shown.
- Although technically a change, a new damage popup system has replaced the old one. It comes with both visual and internal changes.
  - Skills and states that did not show damage popups (e.g. anything involving SP) will now either show a popup or work as intended.
- The equip compare menu now shows life steal and attack element changes.
- The status menu's "Attributes" page now shows life steal stats.

### Changes
- Replaced the Forge Badge and Enchanting Badge with the Disposable Hammer and Enchanting Crystal, respectively. This is only a visual change, and the items still function exactly the same.
- Obtaining any craftable item will mark it as crafted, even before hitting the Blazing Sands. This unmasks the name of the item and counts it towards the total crafting progress statistics in the crafting menu.
- Loading/renaming a save now marks it as the "last accessed" file, making it automatically selected when the save menu is open.
- Opening the options/save menu on the title screen will smoothly fade out the title screen and fade in the new menu. Leaving the menu will fade it out, then fade the title screen back in.
- Adjusted the layout of the status menu's "Attributes" page. Additionally, the first two columns of attributes have had their names reformatted.
- The equipment comparison menu now rounds the difference of most stats to 1 decimal place.
- Reverted the new item indicator's appearance to its vA.14.0-UNST1 state.
- The new item indicator now shows on the victory aftermath screen again.
- Removed equip restrictions on Terra and Bubble (Tome).
- When changing the equipment in a party member's Vanity slot, unequippable vanity items will not be shown.
- Adjusted dialogue in Adon finale dream cutscene.
- The preloader will now load animation files.
- Changed the icons of the Charm of Foresight and several vanity items.

### Balancing
- Nerfed the Sacrificial Dagger's CRI boost from +3% to +1.5%.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug where unallocating HP/MP when full would reduce MHP/MMP, then additionally remove another 5/3 HP/MP, leaving the party member without full HP/MP.
- Fixed a bug where two completely unobtainable weapons were being added to the total weapons crafted stat's denominator.
- Fixed a bug where the spacing of letters on name input screens would be uneven.
- Fixed a bug where the sell price of Bronze/Steel Alloys was abnormally high... 3x higher than intended, in fact.
- Fixed a bug where Player 4's vanities were still causing her face graphic to smile when in Telluria, even though this was meant to be removed in vA.14.3.
- Fixed a bug where the Sea BGS would not fade out during the cutscene where the party clears the dirt pile in the north of the Blazing Sands.
- Fixed many textual errors.

Items being automatically marked as crafted will work retroactively with previous saves. As long as an item has been hovered over in the items menu at least once before updating, the updated save will mark the item as crafted.
Run over all the items in your inventory before updating to be sure they don't have the new item indicator. This will ensure that any craftable items are properly marked as crafted.

# Alpha 14.4 (12/16/2021)
Considering that Alpha 14.3 was intended to be the last sub-alpha with notable content, Alpha 14.4 doesn't have anything too crazy. However, there's plenty of bug fixes and changes that make this update worth it!

### Additions
- Added 2 new armors:
  - Iron Boots
  - Slime Scarf
- Added a new feature that allows save files to be renamed.

### Changes
- Player 4 no longer learns Steal Item at level 12, and will instead learn Offensive Stance. Transferred saves with Player 4 already at level 12 or above will automatically have her skills updated.
- Deleting a save file will now just apply .bak to the end of the file instead of completely deleting it, allowing accidentally deleted save files to be retrieved.
- A Game Over will now be triggered if the entire party is afflicted with either Downed or Terrified.
  - This was mainly done to prevent long battles against Lost Souls when your only living party members were incapacitated by Terrified.
- Will now sells ATK, MAT, DEF, and MDF scrolls.
- The Knight and Rogue classes now have a Magic Equip equipment slot.
- The shop menu's sell window now shows category icons in a 4x4 grid.
- Puzzle reset buttons now require confirmation before resetting the puzzle.
- Changed the recipe for Vishnu's Charm to use the Slime Scarf.
- Slightly increased the encounter rate in the Bandito Hideout.
- Some dialogues will be altered slightly depending on actions that have been done during the game (e.g. the party only knows about the Archaic Hourglass when fighting The Warden if Will has given them the quest).

### Balancing
- Changed around some item drop rates.
  - Buffed the drop rate of rare enemy accessories from 20% to 33.3%.
  - Buffed the drop rate of status resistance accessories from 1% to 2%.
  - Buffed the drop rate of presents from 10% to 20%.
- Adjusted the Floppy Hat ★ and the Prayer Headpiece to function more as counterparts to each other, with the former focusing on MAT and the latter focusing on MDF.
- Buffed Ice I's MAT multiplier from 200% to 225%.
- Nerfed The Warden's offensive stats slightly to allow for more fair on-level interactions.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a bug with the Lost Soul AI that caused battles against it to sometimes take a really long time. The bug also sometimes prevented party members from being able to do anything for no apparent reason.
- Fixed a bug with the Lightning I/II chain lightning formulas.
- Fixed a bug where saves transferred from vA.14.4 would softlock upon entering Player 1's house. This was because the "Player 2's Meal" cutscene would be triggered.
- Fixed a bug where boosting and then unboosting could allow escape from normally unescapable battles.
- Fixed a bug where Shield of Faith and Strength Within the Blade's shield would expire after 5 or 2 turns, respectively.
- Fixed a bug where Player 3 and Player 4 could escape Sector 4 when ditching the rest of the party.
- Fixed a bug where The Warden wouldn't apply Terrified to the party at the beginning of his battle.
- Fixed a bug where Henry's Play Dirty skill could fill up the battle log.
- Fixed a bug where skills with a learn requirement of level 0 would still show the level requirement.
- Fixed several bugs related to interactions between the Blazing Sands's godrays and the nighttime overlay.
- Fixed several bugs related to footstep sounds in many locations.
- Fixed an oddly specific bug related to the statue of Trailia in Solus Valley and the Shop Menu Stat Compare Style option.
- Fixed many other minor bugs.

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.3 (12/11/2021)
This sub-alpha is a pretty important one! It shakes up the progression in early Telluria, and fixes a ton of bugs. Let's get straight into the changelog!

### Additions
- Added in a brand new cutscene at the start of Chapter 3.
  - This cutscene replaces some old content, notably the camping cutscene when first setting foot on Telluria.
- Added in 4 new Vanity equipment items.

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.2 (11/30/2021)
Another sub-alpha! This one fixes quite a few bugs with the game, and also addresses feedback given by the community.

### Additions
- Re-added the equip optimize button, a missed feature from Alpha 13.
- Recovery item descriptions will show how much HP/MP they recover, both static and percentage.
- Added a merchant in Sector 2 of Adon that sells Small Potions and Small Elixirs. He will disappear after Laeryidyean has been defeated.
  - As a result of this, the soldier outside the Bandito Hideout that's always sold Small Elixirs will now sell them at 16B rather than 20B.

### Changes
- Replaced Player 1's Defend I/II and Mark skills with three new skills.
  - Hold the Line I: Learned by Player 1 at level 5.
  - Hold the Line II: Learned by Player 1 through the skill menu starting at level 15.

  - All enemies that used Defend I/II or Mark in their AI have had their AI modified to use the new skills.
  - Already-existing save files will retroactively learn the new skills and have the old ones removed. Mastery levels will be migrated.

- The status menu and equip comparison menu now have 1 decimal of precision for stats other than the main 8.
- Player 1, Player 2, and Player 4 can now all learn Analyze using the skill learn menu.
- Skeleton Warriors and Skeleton Mages can now drop Small Potions and Small Elixirs.
- Completely disabled the battle intro. It was just too buggy and the effect wasn't worth it. Besides, most people just turn it off after the first few times.
- Reduced the amount of skeletons found in Laeryidyean's Forest - Center.
- Trimmed down some dialogue in a few spots.

### Balancing
- Nerfed the Skeleton Mage.
  - ATK: 10 → 8
  - DEF: 12 → 9
  - MAT: 24 → 20
  - MDF: 24 → 20
  - Cure I will now be used at or below 30% HP rather than the old 50%.
  - Cure I will only have a 60% chance of being used when meeting the HP condition rather than the old 100%.
- Nerfed the Skeleton Warrior.
  - MDF: 20 → 12
- Reduced the cost of Floppy Hat ★ from 50B to 35B.
- Nerfed Charm of Foresight from +10% CEV to +5% CEV

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed an annoying bug where skipping through Player 2's dialogue during the walk-and-talk with him could softlock the game.
- The Items menu and the Run Away option can no longer be selected with at least 1 boost active.
- Fixed a bug where Player 2 could leave Sector 2 by himself while Player 1 and Mark are talking.
- A lot of minor textual errors were fixed.

<br><br>

# Alpha 14.1 (11/26/2021)
Here we are, the first sub-alpha for Alpha 14. It came quickly, too!
This little update mainly serves to add... holiday content! That's right, for the month of December, you'll get access to some fun new stuff.
Additionally, some issues found in Alpha 14 have been addressed in order to further improve the gameplay experience.

### Additions
- The holidays are here! A few special things will start happening during the month of December:
  - Every enemy in the game has a 10% chance to drop a Present.
  - A new NPC known as the Holiday Merchant can be found in all 6 towns in the game, even during the prologue. He'll sell you all the new holiday items in exchange for Presents.
  - The game's window skin receives a jolly coat of paint. Additionally, the menu particles change to snowflakes!
- The affectionately dubbed "Snowlus Town" has returned at long last! I unfortunately don't know how to automate the tiles changing just yet, so the town will be reverted to its old greenness in the first update of 2022.
- Added in 7 new holiday themed items:
  - Present
  - Fizzy Cranberry Beverage
  - Festive Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger Scroll
  - Icon Reset Scroll
- Added in 5 new holiday themed weapons:
  - Candy Cane Sword/Wand/Staff/Dagger
  - Leek Sword
- Added in 5 new holiday themed armors:
  - Festive Armor/Robes/Vestments/Leathers
  - Candy Cane Shield
- Aside from those, another 6 armors have been added to the game that can be found at any time:
  - Leather Charm
  - Music Box
  - Vishnu's Charm
  - Condensed White Gel
  - Metallic Rat Pelt
  - Arcane Leather Charm

### Changes
- Changed around drops of state resistance accessories to be more consistent. Additionally, the accessories will always have a 1% drop from their enemy type, regardless if the specific enemy is normal, rare, or a boss.
- The location of the Bandito Loot found in the drawers in the Bandito Hideout has been randomized using the new "Playthrough Seed" set at the start of each run. It's a 50/50 chance to be one drawer or the other.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed a few problems with the Linux release of the game.
- Fixed the positioning of the gab window as to not overlap with the map name display.
- Fixed issues with the Village Headman's turning during the story of the Great Collapse.
- Fixed textual errors in a few spots.

# Alpha 14: The Overhaul Update (11/25/2021)
This is it. The update you all have been waiting for. Just like always, the latest update is the biggest one to date.
Consider this like a second or third fresh start for The Trail. I don't know, I don't remember what number we're on.
The sheer amount of changes, additions, bug fixes, and balancing is unprecedented in the history of The Trail. In fact, they are so great in number that I won't even bother to create an actual changelog.

Yeah, maybe I'm lazy. But at the same time, this is such an incredibly large overhaul that it can feel like a different game at times. Maybe it's not right to consider this an updated version of Alpha 13, and instead think of it as a re-imagining of the game.
There's a lot of things that will jump out at you as soon as you start playing the game. However, there's also an incredible amount of very small, barely noticeable things I've changed across the board that give the game a breath of fresh air.
Well, here is the lackluster "changelog" (hey, the less spoilers the better, right?):

### Additions
- Added a new passive skill: Simp. It's unlocked by Player 2 at level 1 and is always active.

From awesome additions like a new dungeon for the Water Elemental, all the way to dope new mechanics like a time system, this update has it all.
Well... all may be a bit of understatement. While Alpha 14 is "The Overhaul Update," taking care of mostly every aspect of the game I've wanted to revisit for 3+ years, it's still not all-encompassing. However, it... still covers a ridiculously large number of bases.

### Changes
A huge amount of changes were made across the entire game, as expected. Some are obvious, like the 1280x720 resolution and music update, but did you notice stuff like how the status effect "On Fire!" now does constant damage over time instead of percentage-based?

Now, imagine a small change like that, and then have like 5000 of them. Yeah, a TON of stuff was changed. Praise be to the person who goes through all my GitHub commits and compiles everything together into a nice changelog!

(Seriously though, if someone managed to one day document every change made in this update, they would certainly have all my praises bestowed upon them.)

### Balancing
Look, I finally nerfed the crit formula. That's probably one of the most prominent balancing changes here.
However, I did make changes across the board to almost every piece of equipment and skill. The game should feel considerably more fair in many aspects now.

Oh, but how could I neglect to mention this? The battle system has been revamped, placing a lot of emphasis on the new Boost Point mechanic, as well as buffs/debuffs to stats that function on a scale from -5 to 5 (think Pokémon).

This is a part of the update that we will need a particularly high amount of community feedback to properly adjust and balance. Please leave any and all feedback in the Discord server!

### Bug Fixes
Fixed an INCREDIBLE amount of bugs, ranging from new to old to ancient.

### Bugs We Are Aware Of
Yes, there are STILL just a couple bugs I haven't managed to squash from Alpha 13, and a few have popped up during the development of Alpha 14 that I haven't found a fix for just yet. Apologies for that...

But hey, there's no more need for this section thanks to the issue tracker on GitHub! It's been nice having this here for a while, but it's finally time to move on. Check out the issue tracker via the link below.
https://github.com/NoLongerLucky/thetrail/issues

### Planned features
Well, what do you know? Everything on this list has finally been ticked off. Looks like it might be time to retire this section too. It hasn't ever served much of a purpose, either...

### Final Words

Out of all the updates that I have ever developed for The Trail, this has by far been the most daunting yet fun to undertake. It's been amazing to see the game change and transform so much.
The Trail is finally starting to be like what I imagined it to be like all those years ago. All this time spent on it is paying off; I'm finally shaping the game to be just how I always wanted.

Now that the overhauling is finally out of the way, we will of course have a few sub-Alpha 14s to address bugs and make adjustments after listening to community feedback. However...
Alpha 15 approaches next. And while nothing might ever manage to top Alpha 14 in terms of sheer difference from the prior version, this upcoming update will be a jaw-dropper.
Telluria Castle... it approaches.

But as always...

...the journey continues.

Yours truly,
Andrew

<br><br>

# Alpha 13.2 (5/22/2021)
Current Level Cap: 15

Fixed a hardlock when Andy would go to get Bloodlust.
The game would completely freeze and be unplayable.
This was due to his move route trying to move him into the drawer, which is obviously impossible.

<br><br>

# Alpha 13.1 (1/18/2021)
Current Level Cap: 15

Bug fixes.

<br><br>

# Alpha 13: The Desert Update (11/26/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

Finally! We're out of the seemingly endless cycle of Alpha 12s, and Alpha 13 is here!

Let's just cut to the chase. Yeah, this update took a while to come out. But at the same time, it's probably the biggest update... well, ever!
The sheer amount of content here is unparalleled. Give the changelog a read and you'll quickly understand what I mean.

As you can see, we have a couple new sections. The "Balancing" one is here to stay, but "Water Elemental Balancing" is only for this release. The Water Elemental was changed so much that she needs her own section!

Anyways... onto this big, big changelog. So much stuff!

- Added in 5 (yes, FIVE!) new dungeons; play through to unlock them...

- Every single skill that previously featured a damage variance will now have a variance of 5%.
  - This will allow for more calculated plays instead of relying on sheer luck.

  - This will be the new standard variance for all future skills that will have variance.
- Some changes were made to the rendering engine that allow for HD fullscreen.
- Only one Bloodlust can be obtained now, meaning it and all its variants/upgrades can no longer be discarded. If you already have one, don't get rid of it!
- Player 2's MDF increases should now be consistent instead of having a slow curve up.
- Foresight is no longer an instant cast.
- Updated scene_battleretry.ogg.
- Every General Store now sells the same wares. New wares are unlocked as you progress through the game.

- Removed the Cleansing Scroll.
- Your party members will no longer follow you in dungeons with contact encounters.
- Heavily reduced the encounter rate in all dungeons.

- You can now see status effects on the main menu.
- Rejuvenation's regeneration effect no longer persists outside of battle.
- Barkeep's drinks no longer lose their effects on death.
- Reduced the Knight class's overall MDF.
- A lot of attacks shouldn't fail anymore.
- You can now fight with your bare fists, if you really want to.
- It was made more obvious that you need a letter of recommendation to get into the Greenfield Mayor's office.
- Four-Toed Kevin is no longer immune to being frozen.
- Updated the signs in Laeryidyean's forest.
- Made some changes to the Village Headman's dialogue in the church.
- Reduced the size of save files.
- Cleaned up the game's files a bit (mostly old BGMs), in turn reducing its size by a fair amount.
- We've continued to further optimize the game.

### Balancing:
- Rebalanced Wand Impulse [12 MP → 14 MP ; 20% On Fire! → 33% On Fire!].
- Buffed Rejuvenation [15 MP → 11 MP ; HP +16% MHP → HP +30% MHP ; 15% HP over 3 turns → 20% HP over 4 turns]
- Buffed Mana Wisp [a.mat * 1.2 - b.mdf * 2 → a.mat * 1.5 - b.mdf * 2].
- Buffed Channel Divinity I [8 MP → 7 MP].
- Buffed the Fulfilling Ration [HP +20 → HP +30].
- Nerfed Confuse [6 MP → 8 MP].
- Nerfed Bloodlust [16% Bleeding → 10% Bleeding].
- Nerfed Andy's Dusters [16% Confused → 10% Confused].
- Nerfed the Metal Wristbraces ★ [MDF +4 → MDF +3 ; MMP +6 → MMP +4].
- Nerfed the Metal Wristbraces [MDF +2 → MDF +1 ; MMP +3 → MMP +2].
- Nerfed the Anti-Magic Charm ★ [MAT -3 → MAT -2 ; MDF +8 → MDF +6].
- Nerfed the Anti-Magic Charm [MAT -5 → MAT -3 ; MDF +5 → MDF +3].
- Nerfed the Giant Goblin's Rage [DEF * 0.85 → DEF * 0.80].
- Nerfed the Recovery Vat [Buy/Sell 200/100 → Buy/Sell 500/250]

### Water Elemental Balancing:
- Rebalanced the Water Elemental.
  - MHP: 2500 → 2400
  - ATK: 12 → 14
  - MAT: 45 → 40
  - MDF: 45 → 40
  - Pure Water: [a.mat * 5 → a.mat * 3.75]
  - Waterfall: [a.mat * 3 - b.mdf * 2 → a.mat * 2 - b.mdf * 2]
  - Attack Usage: [HP 85% ~ 100% → HP 75% ~ 100%]
  - Bubble Usage: [HP 30% ~ 100% → HP 10% ~ 90%]
  - Waterfall Usage: [HP 0% ~ 30% → HP 0% ~ 25%]
  - We intended the Water Elemental to be a tough introduction to Telluria, but until now, it's always been an extremely difficult fight that almost always required grinding before it. We want the fight to be tough, but not impossible.
    These changes reflect the Water Elemental we intended to be in the game: a boss about staying alive as long as possible while you dish out damage. She is slightly less tanky now, and her attacks are nowhere near as devastating. Her physical attack is also slightly more viable now to compensate.
    The attack usage changes should also help make the fight flow better. For the first 10% of the fight, she will only use her default physical attack. This will give players a bit more leeway to get adjusted to the fight before being pummeled by water.
    Bubble's usage has been extended from ending at 30% HP all the way down to 10% HP. This will prevent her from constantly spamming Waterfall for the last 30% of the fight.
    We'd appreciate any feedback we can get on the fight. It will continue to be looked at and rebalanced in the future if needed.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a long-lasting bug where the game would randomly freeze.
  - Well... it should be fixed. Since I can't really replicate the freeze, I'm not sure if it really is fixed. If your game freezes, PLEASE say something in #bugs!
- Fixed a long-lasting bug where item notetags would be continued to be parsed midgame.
  - Basically, whenever I would update a special trait of an item, like the upgrade slots or the crafting recipe, instances of the item that had already been created would not be changed. This should be fixed now, though.
  - Note that stats such as ATK and MAT on an item will still not be updated when changed in the game's code.
- Fixed a long-lasting bug where only your right ear got to know that you upgraded a weapon or piece of equipment.
- Fixed a long-lasting bug where you couldn't access Sam's wares unless you talked to him while standing directly behind him.
- Fixed a bug where Channel Divinity I would count as a certain hit instead of a magic hit.
- Fixed a bug where Channel Divinity I would factor ATK and DEF into the formula instead of MAT and MDF.
- Fixed a bug where the Bronze Sword ★ would set enemies on fire.
- Fixed a bug where the Water Elemental did not react to ice correctly.
- Fixed a bug where the Tome of Experience was not sorted into the Buffs category. 
- Fixed a bug where Silence, Sleep, and Confuse could be usable from the skills menu on the map.
- Fixed a bug where Defend! I would defend against any kind of attack, granted that the person being attacked had lower HP than the defender.
- Fixed a bug where 20% of damage would not penetrate the Shield of Faith.
- Fixed a bug where Magic Prone I would not be removed by debuff-curing skills.
- Fixed a bug where Steal Item's animation did not work.
- Fixed a bug where you could discard boss powers.
- Fixed a bug where Sam would remain at the end of the Final Stretch even after you killed Laeryidyean.
- Fixed several minor bugs throughout the game.
- Fixed many, many textual errors.

### Bugs we are aware of:
- Sprites occasionally visually clip through certain tiles.
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing.
 
### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Full (or near-full) replacement of default RMMV content.

Alpha 12... it came out on the 2020 Trailiversary, as a way to kick off the Year of the Community.
As with all updates, it was welcomed well, and while not perfect by any means, it still shook up a lot of stuff in the game, and added a ton of awesome new content.

Now we have Alpha 13. This update is an entirely new level of additional content, adding hours of new gameplay and a boatload of new items, mechanics, and more. The sheer level of content shoved into this update is insane, and I'm sure everyone will enjoy it.

However... this was meant to all come out over the summer. Now we're nearing the end of 2020, and it's taken this long to release Alpha 13.
Now, I have had school and a lot of other things popping up along the way to delay the update. Thing is, I'm gonna' be honest and say that a big part of this delay was due to laziness and me not devoting enough time to the game.
Alpha 13 could easily could have been completed months ago, but... well, here we are. We're in late November. Isn't it crazy to think that we might have already had Alpha 14 right now if I hadn't procrastinated? If only...

Well, it's too late to change anything. All we can do it look forward and hope for the best in the future.

Trailsgiving is here. Enjoy, my dear friends.

And you know what? Trailmas is coming up soon. Who knows? Maybe a month is all the time we need to cook up a nice surprise...

Yours truly,
Andrew & Brendan

# UNSTABLE BUILD 4 (9/13/2020)

We're back again with another unstable build!

This release doesn't see any crazy additions. There's the Crusher Cave, along with the Henry fight, and there's also been a few balance changes here and there. Other than that, there's not much.

With Henry out of the way and the Crushers defeated, that means that the gang problem in Bladesville has been solved! Right?

...

Unstable Build 5 will follow up shortly.

Yours truly,
Andrew

<br><br>

# UNSTABLE BUILD 3 (8/28/2020)

NOTE: Variables kinda' broke. If you've even TOUCHED the Great Pyramid, please let me know so I can fix up your save for you.

Ayy, more command icons! Let's go!

But for real, this unstable build is huge, and it finally brings a close to the Eternal Unrest quest.

The Ruined Fort is finally complete. After so much hype surrounding it, it's finally done. It's quite a large dungeon, and while it may not be challenging per se, it's definitely pretty atmospheric.
Of course, there is a boss at the end. The boss in question? Well... I'm not going to spoil that for you. Go through and find out for yourself!

We've made a big change to damage variance. Every skill that previously featured a variance now has a variance of 5%. This will allow for more calculated plays instead of relying on sheer luck.
I'm looking at you, Lightning I: you were chilling with 40% variance.

Oh, and the intro of the game has been updated, so feel free to check it out if you want to get updated on all the latest lore.

Anyways, that's about it. Eternal Unrest: Quest Complete!

But wait a second... what about the Town Master's quests? He's been chilling with no function for a while. Looks like it's time to start working on that.

Yours truly,
Andrew

<br><br>

# UNSTABLE BUILD 2 (7/30/2020)

Another unstable build is here! This time we got some sweet stuff: the Great Pyramid, some new equipment, smooth camera scrolling, and the long-awaited HD fullscreen!

The first thing you'll probably notice when you open the game, provided that you play in fullscreen, is the definition around the edges of every sprite. Using some brand new tech, we've managed to eliminate most of the blurriness of fullscreen!

The next thing you'll notice when you start walking around is how smooth the camera is. That's all there is to it. Smooth camera. Yeah.

And of course, there's the Great Pyramid! It's the next dungeon in the Blazing Sands's questline, and it's definitely a switch up from other dungeons.

The oasis is mapped now, but there's not much there. Other than that, this release has made a lot of balance changes and fixed a ton of bugs!

Oh, and Bloodlust ★'s lifesteal should actually work now. This makes it even more OP!

I hope you enjoy this. I plan on the Great Pyramid becoming a standard for all dungeons in the future. When you go through it, you'll see what I mean.

Yours truly,
Andrew

<br><br>

# UNSTABLE BUILD 1 (7/17/2020)

Hey everyone, thanks for downloading the first unstable build for Alpha 13. This is actually the first unstable build EVER, so apologies if I've messed anything up.

Well, Bladesville and the Blazing Sands are finally here! Feel free to head into the desert, granted that you've gotten the soldiers from Greenfield and Solus Valley to help you out already.

There's also been quite a few other changes around the game. They shouldn't be that big, though.

PLEASE NOTE THIS: Not everything in the changelog is in the game yet! It's most notable that only one dungeon is currently in the game, but there's also some other stuff missing.

Well, I hope y'all enjoy this. It's not too much content, but hopefully it'll keep you busy for a bit. A lot of work on Alpha 13 has been work on mechanics and plugin compatibility, so with the base done, be ready to see a lot of updates real fast.

Yours truly,
luckyandrew13

# Alpha 12.9 (5/28/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

This update brings a few new footstep sounds into the mix, fixes some long-lasting bugs, and most notably makes some key changes to how accessories work.

Remember not knowing the difference between primary and secondary accessories? Remember how frustrating it was to try to mix and match accessories when Metal Wristbraces and Anti-Magic Charms were always the best combo? Well, that's no longer a problem now!
All accessories are now just accessories; no primary and secondary. There's also three accessory slots available for each character, making a lot of new combinations possible, and even viable!
The only issue is that those who transfer their saves will most likely encounter a lot of issues with their already-existing accessories. You'll probably have to rebuy a lot of accessories. Apologies for the inconvenience! But hey, this is an alpha after all.

Anyways, the changelog is right below.

### Additions:
- Added in a few footstep sounds for outdoors surfaces.
  - Indoor surfaces are still yet to come.
- Added a link to the Discord server on the main menu.

### Changes:
- Accessories have been heavily reworked.
- Reduced the upgrade slot capability of a few accessories.
- Increased the MP cost of Double Slash [6 MP → 7 MP].
- Reduced the MP cost of Wand Impulse [14 MP → 12 MP].
- Reverted the screen when applying items on a character back to normal.
- Reduced the length of the animation for Revival.
- The entry/exit to Solus Town is now just one tile.

### Bug Fixes:
- After reviewing Sector 2 and determining it's extremely buggy, I went through and decided to remake a lot of it. It should have the same content, just no more bugs... hopefully. Thanks to ApocalypseGamer1 for finding this out!
  - This has been around since like... what, Alpha 5? Alpha 6? I don't know, but whenever it was, it's been a while.
- Fixed a bug where some of the options on the in-game menu weren't showing.
- Fixed a bug where "Inspire" was usable in the map's skills menu.
- Fixed a bug where Player 4's skill "Master Rogue I" wouldn't show up in the skills menu or be in effect.
- Fixed a bug where you could and Player 2 could sleep at the Verdin Village inn even if you didn't have 20B.
- Fixed a bug where "The Trail" wouldn't be unlocked in the music menu.

### Bugs we are aware of:
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing.
- Only your right ear gets to know that you upgraded a weapon or piece of equipment.
 
### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Polishing up a lot of the game (this will be the main focus of Alpha 14).
- Replacement of default RMMV content (music remaking is well underway, the graphics overthrow is still in planning).

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.8 (5/15/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

Just ignore everything I've said before about "final minor releases" and "no more bugs." Yeah, scratch all of it. Here's my new statement:

We're gonna' keep releasing minor alphas all the way up to the release of Alpha 13. This is in order for us to continue fixing bugs and not overload Alpha 13 with changes and fixes.

There's some pretty important changes and some nice additions here, and the most notable change is the skill reordering. IF YOU HAVE ANY PARTY MEMBERS BETWEEN LEVELS 12-15, PLEASE CONTACT ME! You may be missing some skills!

Anyways, here's the changelog. And remember: all these sub-alphas are a result of work on Alpha 13. It's still coming along steadily!

### Additions:

  - Brown Mushroom
  - Red Mushroom

- Fixed a bug where sleeping in your bed would not fade the screen back in.

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.7 (5/13/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

There can't be any more bugs. We've scoured the game for them, going through so many potential, so if there's any more bugs... well, beats me.

Anyways, there's also a TON of changes. Once again, I got side-tracked while developing Alpha 13, and I just couldn't wait to release all these changes. So here you go.

### Additions:
- Can't even be bothered to think of something funny to put here.
- There's no new additions.
 
### Changes:
- All status effect timers and DoT effects are now applied at the end of a full turn.
- Bumped up the party member name limit to 10 characters.
  - This has been requested since the First Release! I think I didn't change it because I was worried about how the spacing of stuff would respond to longer names, but this should be fine.
- Mana Wisp can now land a critical hit.
- Reduced the DoT of "On Fire!" [b.mhp * 0.08 → b.mhp * 0.05].
- Reduced the healing of "Cure I" [a.mat * 1.6 → a.mat * 1.2].
- Reduced the healing of "Pure Water" [a.mat * 6 → a.mat * 5].
- Reduced the drop rate of the "Loaf of Bread" from goblins [1/3 → 1/5].
- Nerfed the Soldier's Shield [3 DEF → 2 DEF; 70B → 80B].
- Made the "Loaf of Bread" more expensive [20B → 24B].
- 20% of damage will penetrate the Shield of Faith.
- Bleeding now does a minimum of 1 damage.
- Loose items in Adon can now be picked up.
- The numerical ID of the "Defeat Apocalypse" quest was changed to be 1000 instead of 4. This means that the quest will no longer be the first one to automatically pop up in the quest window every time you clear a quest.
- Adjusted the GUI when using items so that the player can see how many of the item they have left.
- Removed the mini-dialogue at the start of all battles except for one-time battles. They were an interesting concept, but quickly grew stale, and they also covered up part of the GUI.
- Made some changes to the contents of a few chests around the game.
- Decimation now removes the "Soaked" status effect.
- Flowers and herbs are now classified as materials.
- Removed "Under Sam's Shop" from the music menu
- Player 1 and Player 2 now recover all their HP and MP before the Smart Mouth fight.
- The sign in Solus Town now uses arrows to signify direction.
- The text on the signs at the start of dungeons is no longer centered. 
- Renovated the General Store in Solus Town to look more like the other buildings in town.
- Changed Adam's pathing.
 
### Bug Fixes:
- The game can no longer be softlocked by ending Player 2's walk-and-talk early.
- Fixed a bug where you could leave Haven Harbor before getting back together with your team.

- Fixed a bug where your sprite wouldn't go back to normal after the dream with Matt.
- Fixed a bug where the three Well-Fed buffs didn't increase your agility.

### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Different footstep sounds depending on which surface you're walking on.
- Replacement of default RMMV content (music remaking is already underway, the graphics overthrow is still in planning).
 
NOW the sub-Alpha 12's should finally be done... hopefully. I've fit so many changes and bug fixes into them that there just can't be any more I can do.
Well, on to Alpha 13!

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.6 (5/11/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

Hey, we've hit a new record for sub-alphas! All the way up to six now... impressive.

#alpha-help in the Discord has gotten a fresh coat of paint, and it's now #faq! If you have questions and aren't sure if they've been answered, make sure to check the channel out.

Finally, exactly two months after the release of Alpha 12, this will be the final minor release before Alpha 13, unless any game-breaking bugs are found.
It's frustrating having to constantly block off the desert and then unblock it every time I make a release, and I also really want to focus solely on Bladesville and everything.
Don't worry: we've got our act together now. Alpha 13 will hopefully come out in summer, so the release drought won't be too long this time around.

Anyways, here's some bug fixes and changes. Some pretty big ones, too.

### Additions:
- Added a new passive skill: Simp. It's unlocked by Player 2 at level 1 and it's always active.
 
### Changes:
- The skill and item menus in-battle is now one column on the left of the screen.
  - This consequently fixes the bug where the turn order display would cover skill and item names.
- Lowered the amount of Cool-Looking Hats found behind the church in Solus Town [2 → 1].
- Lowered the volume of the footstep sound [10% → 5%].
- Lowered the volume of the night ambience in Solus Town after hours [40% → 25%].
- Skeletons and slimes can no longer be inflicted with Bleeding.
- Changed the audio track scene_dream.
- Updated the icon set.
 
### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where weapons that are meant to apply states on attack don't (e.g. Bloodlust, Andy's Dusters).
  - At long last!
  - This fix will unfortunately only work on newly-acquired weapons, but that's fine, since Bloodlust and Andy's Dusters, the only two weapons with this trait, will be outclassed in Alpha 13.
- Fixed a bug where re-entering Solus Town with the guard in tow and then leaving would cause the guard to show up again. Just a visual bug, though, so you wouldn't end up with two guards.
- Fixed a bug where scene_adonsaved wouldn't play at the start of the Adon celebration.
- Fixed a bug where Apocalypse's name box wouldn't show up after finding out his name during the dream with him.
- Fixed some inconsistencies between the separate maps for Solus Town and Solus Town: After Hours.
- Fixed some textual errors.
 
### Bugs we are aware of:
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing.

### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Different footstep sounds depending on which surface you're walking on.
- Replacement of default RMMV content (the music overhaul is well underway, the graphics overhaul is still in planning).
 
And before you ask: no, Player 2 does not actually have a passive skill called Simp.

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.5 (5/7/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

Once again, here are some more additions and changes that were made during the development of Alpha 13. And once again, we deemed that it would be better to release them ASAP instead of waiting for Alpha 13.
Besides, don't all the minor updates give the game a bit more life? I think they do.
Anyways... short changelog. No bug fixes either.

### Additions:
- Player 1 has a couple dreams now.
  - One is right after the mountain sunset scene.
  - One is when you sleep in your bed after defeating Laeryidyean.
- There's some ruins lying around The Overworld now. These serve as some world-building and stuff for players to figure out for themselves. Just little details, y'know.
- The gravestones in Solus Town now have witty little two-liners I spent an hour making up.
  - I hate myself.

### Changes:
- Updated the Map of Adon sprite, finally!
- The lookout point that features the iconic mountain sunset scene is now visitable outside the cutscene. The area has been updated too.

### Bug Fixes:
- Nothing to see here.

### Bugs we are aware of:
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing.
- The game rarely freezes (an unfortunate occurrence found in most RMMV games), but it's only visually; if you know how to navigate the game well enough, you can save in the frozen state and then reload the game to avoid losing any progress.
 
### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Different footstep sounds depending on which surface you're walking on.
- Replacement of default RMMV content (music remaking is already underway, the graphics overthrow is still in planning).

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.4: The Brendan Update (it's his birthday) (4/22/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

As I was developing Alpha 13, I made a few critical changes and bug fixes. Since Alpha 13 won't be out for some time, I thought it best to release them now, separate from the additions that will come in Alpha 13.
The removal of the ability to spare Laeryidyean in Alpha 12.3 is a pretty major change, plot-wise. The changes in this update also have a pretty big impact on the story.
Remember, since the game is still in an alpha phase, a lot of things are changing around. Brendan and I practically rewrote the entire story of the game a few days ago, so we had to go back and change some things that no longer really made sense.
We hope all of you understand this.

### Additions:
- Added in 1 new music track: "Saviors Of Adon".

### Changes:
- Redid some of the game's intro dialogue.
- The Soul can no longer be named.
- Removed Augments.
- Revamped the Aqua Gem and Gem Ring.
  - The former is now used as a crafting material for water-related items.
  - The latter can now hold many upgrade slots.
- Nerfed the DEF and MDF scrolls (-1 for their respective stat, taking it down to 2).
- Nerfed Terra (-6% Earth resist, down to +10%).
- After you defeat Laeryidyean and go back up Adon celebrating, "Saviors Of Adon" will now play instead of "The Trail".
- Removed "The Vessel" from the music menu.
- The Water Elemental now drops XP (300).
- Updated several icons.
- Cleaned up the game files.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the flowers outside Jack's house wouldn't disappear after collecting them.
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't read Kevin's note.
- Fixed a bug where Barkeep would always tell you to come back if you interest was "every" piqued.
- Fixed several other textual errors.

### Bugs we are aware of:
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing.
- The game rarely freezes (an unfortunate occurrence found in most RMMV games), but it's only visually; if you know how to navigate the game well enough, you can save in the frozen state and then reload the game to avoid losing any progress.
- The Map of Adon isn't completely up-to-date: once we're sure where everything is going to be, I'll make new map graphics.

### Planned features:
- The desert!
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world.
- Different footstep sounds depending on which surface you're walking on.
- Replacement of default RMMV content (very long-term project, will not be finished for a long time).

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.3 (4/8/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

A small update that makes a few important changes. Why, you may ask? Well, since we're in Alpha, a lot of stuff is still being decided. Brendan and I just recently decided to redo a lot of the story, so some things have to go. That's just how it is sometimes.

### Additions:
- The battle retry screen now has a nice scrolling background

### Changes:
- Renamed the "Lightning" element to "Electric"
- You can no longer spare Laeryidyean
- The Narrator no longer speaks to you at the end of Chapter 2
- Removed a music track: "The Choice"
- Disabled keyboard support for name input
- Wood can now be salvaged into sticks
- Replaced the skill "Heavy Attack" with "Boulder Toss"

### Bug Fixes:
- None to be seen...

### Bugs we are aware of:
- When returning to walking around after completing a battle that was retried, the BGM stops playing
- The game rarely freezes (an unfortunate occurrence found in most RMMV games), but it's only visually; if you know how to navigate the game well enough, you can save in the frozen state and then reload the game to avoid losing any progress
- The Map of Adon isn't completely up-to-date: once we're sure where everything is going to be, I'll make new map graphics
 
### Planned features:
- Adding interaction to objects throughout the world
- The content mentioned at the end of Chapter 3 (really just the desert at this point)
- Different footstep sounds depending on which surface you're walking on
- Replacement of default RMMV content (very long-term project, will not be finished for a long time)

<br><br>

# Alpha 12.2 (4/6/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

At long last, the lag is gone! The game now runs at a steady framerate: up to 75 FPS! I recommend turning on the Synch Monitor FPS setting, though, since the game runs more naturally at 60 FPS.
Oh, yeah... and there's side quests! Quite a few side quests! Now there's actually people that need your help! Of course, they didn't need your help until you unlocked the desert for some reason, but... let's ignore that.
Anyways, the changelog. It's definitely the longest changelog yet for a minor update. Goes to show just how much quality of life can be put into a game. Don't worry, if Alpha 12.3 does come out, it'll be considerably quicker since it'll be very minor content.

# Alpha 12.1 (3/22/2020)
Current Level Cap: 15

Just a few bug fixes and some minor changes/additions. I'd like to thank twitch.tv/3d_crushergaming for playing through the game so that I could get an outside perspective on the game and see any obvious bugs that we missed during testing!
Unfortunately, the Mac port still isn't working; I'm on it, though.
Alpha 12.2 is planned to include a variety of side quests, so stay tuned for that!

### Additions:
- You can now sleep in your own bed
- The backstory of Solus Valley is now actually explained (by means of a sign in front of its inn)

- Replacement of default RMMV content (very long-term project, will not be finished for a long time)

# Alpha 12: The Community Update (3/11/2020)
The 2nd Trailiversary is upon us, and with that, the largest amount of quality of life changes in a single update EVER! Alpha 12 features brand new content, a revamped start of the game, UI changes, and, most importantly: the boat no longer makes footstep noises!

Haha, well, it's something more important: Mac and Linux support! That's right, the community has grown to include these other two operating systems!

Content-wise, we're now in Telluria! You can visit Greenfield and Solus Valley, buy and find tons of new items, and fight two new mini-bosses! The content, depending on how you play it, can take 15 minutes to get through, or all the way up to an hour.

The start of the game has also been completely redone. Now, instead of being thrown into some town and being left to complete fetch quests, there's a bit more backstory between Player 1 and other characters, and... well, it's quite a bit to explain. Start up a new save if you want to see.

Ah, yes, UI changes! The game windows now feature a gold trim, and a lot of stuff has been moved around and added to menus, including icons for menu options! There's no real content here, but it helps make the game look nicer and stand out a bit more.

And last but most definitely not least: Mac OS and Linux support! At long last, after many promises and a lot of waiting, Mac and Linux users can finally play The Trail! Note that these two platforms will be much less tested than Windows, so if you find any bugs while using them, make sure to report them, it's much appreciated!

Well, that's enough talking for now. The changelog is just below. It's a lot of stuff, so if you're going to read all of it, I wish you luck. If you don't really care or maybe want 0 spoilers... open up the game and get going!

- The boat actually no longer makes footstep noises anymore (really the peak of this update tbf)
- Fixed a bug where you could still finish off Laeryidyean even when you were downed
- Fixed a bug where subsequent attempts after the first one to head downstairs from the top floor of your house would teleport you to the tutorial (hey, that doesn't exist anymore!)
- Fixed a bug where certain status effects would never go away
- Fixed a bug where reloading the game in Solus Town at night would bug the locations of all NPCs (this was done by restricting save access there)

- Fixed countless textual errors

### Bugs we are aware of:
- There's a memory leak that causes a short delay when closing the menu and after saving
- The game rarely freezes, but it's only visually; if you know how to navigate the game well enough, you can save in the frozen state and then reload the game to avoid losing any progress
- The Map of Adon isn't completely up-to-date: once we're sure where everything is going to be, I'll make new map graphics
 
### Planned features:
- Polishing areas that were added in this release
- The content mentioned at the end of Chapter 3
- Replacement of default RMMV content

Thanks for downloading Alpha 12. I'm sure I can speak on behalf of both me and Brendan when I say we really appreciate the fact that you even went through the trouble of downloading the game at all!
This is the new definitive version of The Trail: I've spent countless hours working on it, and I think it's pretty good. Yes, we will have an update in the future where I revamp the graphics and audio and such to make The Trail as unique as possible.. but for now, it's fine.

The journey continues.

Happy Trailiversary!,
Andrew & Brendan

<br><br>

# Alpha 11.1 (8/16/2019):
- Fixed a game-breaking bug where the game would encounter a game-breaking error every time a new game was started
  - This was due to a missing file. In fact, many files were missing due to an unsuccessful file strip. Files will most likely not be missing again in the future, but at the cost of a slightly higher amount of space taken up by the game.
- Fixed a bug where metadata was parsed incorrectly
- Fixed a bug where the footstep sound would be played while moving in a boat
- Slightly changed a few questionable dialogues
- Fixed a grammatical error in README.txt

<br><br>

# Alpha 11 (8/13/2019)
Here we are.

We've done it.

The Trail is finally complete. Well, at least, a decent amount of it.

We've made it all the way down Adon. 16 months of work, and we've finally done it.

You can't understand how happy we are. The way that this game has developed has been beautiful for me, and I'm so glad that it's finally reached a stable point in development.

Well, here's the very brief changelog.

### Additions:
- The whole thing is just one big addition, isn't it?

### Changes:
- Basically what I said above.

### Bug Fixes:
- Do I really need to repeat myself?

### Bugs we are aware of:
- There's a memory leak when closing the menu and after saving that causes the game to lag
- The game occasionally freezes
- Reloading the game in Solus Town at night bugs the locations of all the characters there.

Yep. No joke here. The prologue all the way through the very beginning of Chapter 3 is complete. I'm honestly at a loss for words. I can't believe that it's finally done. So uh... yeah, have fun playing the game! I've spent... what, hundreds of hours remaking the game? And countless tens bug testing between me and Brendan. And it's basically perfect except for the bugs in the bugs I know about section. Ok, I'm just rambling at this point.

I'll probably be forced to release a couple more Alpha 11s just to change a few things up and bug fix. But Alpha 12 won't be out for a while. So stay tuned, and we'll see you in a few months!

Yours truly,
Andrew & Brendan

<br><br>

# Alpha 10.2 (8/9/2018)
Here are some things that I:
A. Meant to add into Alpha 10 but didn't the time.
B. Completely forgot to do.
So enjoy, I guess- OH and I made another change to the download: there's no more messing around with zipped folders.

### Additions:
- Enemies now have their own attack animations, instead of them all being the default one.
  - Coincidentally, most of the enemies in the game still are using the default animation.
- The Giant Rat has a sprite now (an addition and a bug fix). I had to patch it together in a hurry... how does it look?
- Added in 3 new command window icons.
  - Run Away
  - Load
  - Delete

### Changes:
- Decreased the volume of quite a few in-game animations (a godsend).
- The game no longer skips the Fight/Run Away menu in battle.
- Changed the "Save" command window icon.

**Stable Level: Level 6**

<br><br>

# Alpha 10.1 (8/8/2018)
We're experimenting with a new installer for the game. Other than that, there's no actual content in this update.

**Stable Level: Level 6**

<br><br>

# Alpha 10: The Double Digits Update!™ (8/7/2018)
Hello all, and welcome to Alpha 10! This incredible effort is the biggest update The Trail has ever seen, and we hope you'll enjoy it! Off with the witty remarks and useless chatter, let's head straight to the changelog!

### Additions:
- Added in some amazing scripts, all created by Yanfly! Testing these has been difficult on my part, so if you guys find any bugs or possible improvements, make sure to tell me.
  - Core Engine v1.09, which fixes some bugs in RPG Maker VX Ace and helps run all the other Yanfly scripts.
  - Ace Battle Engine v1.22, which I assume is simply what runs his battle scripts.  Oh, and there's a few other improvements here and there.
  - Visual Battlers v1.01... now your teammates are visible in battles!
  - Victory Aftermath v1.04, which improves the after-battle sequence.
  - Equip Engine v1.06, which improves the equipment tab.
  - Steal Items v1.03, the script that makes Steal Bits work.
  - Gab Window v1.00... I've decided to use this just for sub-maps, but I may change my mind later.
  - Item Menu v1.02, which greatly improves the setup of the item menu.
  - Menu Engine v1.10, which makes some positive changes to the menu in general.
  - Party Sized Menu v1.00 - all it does is change the size of the menu to accompany your party.
  - Save Engine v1.03... woah, my save shows detailed information now!
  - Shop Options v1.01 - nice, shops will show detailed information about items.
  - Status Menu v1.02, which greatly improves the Status tab in the menu.
  - Rename Actor v1.01 - it's pretty self-explanatory.
  - Command Window Icons v1.00... woah! Icons for menu tabs! Awesome!
- Added in the epic finale of your struggle against the Banditos. Now that they're out of the way, there's nothing stopping you from continuing down Adon and defeating Laeryidyean...
- Added in 3 new maps:
  - Bandito Hideout Entrance
  - Bandito Hideout F1
  - Bandito Hideout B1
- Added in a new class: the Rogue.
- Added in 3 new enemies.
  - A harder versions of Big Mouth and Smart Mouth.
  - A new boss... play through the update and find out its identity!
- Added in 3 new skills.
  - Sharpen Dagger, learned by the Rogue at level 3.
  - Steal Bits, learned by the Rogue at level 5.
  - Defend!, learned by the Knight at level 6.
- Added in 6 new items.
  - Novice Dagger
  - Novice Leathers
  - Traveler Dagger (not obtainable as of this update)
  - Cell Key
  - Tome of Experience
  - Scrap of Kevin's Cape
- Added in 3 new states.
  - CRI Up
  - Focused
  - Defending

### Changes:
- Completely overhauled the tutorial! In fact, it's so good that you should make a new save file solely for the purpose of re-completing it! You can thank DMmePlateletMemes#9286 for the awesome suggestion.
  - Of course, since the tutorial was overhauled, we've made a few changes to the prologue in order to accommodate the change. This includes changing dialogue, autosave locations, and anything that'll improve the prologue's quality.
- Changed the Knight skill Double Slash to Focused Slash. Double Slash will be reintroduced as a later skill, with a few buffs, of course.
- Scrapped the "Memory" map featured in Player 2's Story, in favor of showing only the inn.
- Changed the LUK (Luck) stat to INT (Intelligence).
- Changed the size of every enemy in accordance with the new visual battler script.

### Bug Fixes:
- It is no longer possible to obtain more than one Gem Staff from Adam (the red-haired dude who keeps asking you for stuff).
- Fixed a bug where the animation for the Gem Staff was incorrect. Thanks, Brendan!

We are aware that the battle animations and backdrops are a bit oversized in comparison to your party members. Don't worry, the team is tackling this issue right now.

With all the scripts and whatnot, it was definitely necessary for some testing to take place before the public release of Alpha 10. However, some bugs are still bound to be present, so make sure you report these!

Stay tuned for Alpha 11, which will be packed with even more features!

**Stable Level: Level 6**

<br><br>

# Alpha 9 (7/10/2018)
Woohoo, Alpha 9 is here! Let's cut right to the chase, I'm sure you're excited to see the huge amount of additions.

Here's that chase I was talking about:

### Additions:
- Added in 2 new items.
  - Gem Staff
  - Bandito Dagger
- Added in 2 new skills.
  - Ice I: Learned by the Mage at level 5.
  - Cure II: Learned by the Cleric at level 5.
- Added in a new enemy: the Bandito.
- Added in 2 new quests.
  - A Fellow Traveler: Part II
  - The Fourth Sector
- Added in a new status effect: Minor Freeze.
- Added in 3 new cutscenes.
  - One's an epic battle...
  - One's chock-filled with plot...
  - And one's just sad.
- Added in a hidden chest in the Grassland Arena... look for clues!
- The Training Vestments and Training Staff now actually have descriptions.
- The Village Headman has more to tell you, if you care to go back to him... it's nothing important, just recaps if you weren't paying attention to anything he said.
- The shallow water around Telluria has been complete. If you didn't play the game before Alpha 2.3, Telluria is the huge body of land in the center of the world.
- Upon attempting to drink from the small spring in the Forest Arena at least a second time, you now get a notification saying that you cannot drink from it instead of nothing happening.

### Changes:
- Cure I now gives you an extra 30 Agility when using it. This means that you'll have a better chance of healing your teammates before an enemy attacks.
- Cure I now has a slight chance of failing.
- Four-Toed Kevin no longer says anything about "their friends from Verdin Village" because it didn't work with the plot I made.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed the usage message for Cure I.

**Stable Level: Level 5**

<br><br>

# Alpha 8.3 (7/7/2018)
- Fixed a glitch where your teammates would get stuck in the doors of the Verdin Village Inn Shops.

**Stable Level: Level 4**

<br><br>

# Alpha 8.2 (7/6/2018)
An addition and some more changes, including some minor overhauls.

### Additions:
- When you battle Big Mouth in Verdin Village and succeed, you'll receive some items and Bits/Experience now.

### Changes:
- Removed two swear words used by Player 3 upon the request of one of my fellow developers. Apologies if Player 3's rude language offended anyone else.
- Changed the description of the Small Elixir.
- Doubled the healing power of Cure I.
- Now it's time for some major nerfs and buffs. Here we go...
  - Nerfed the Bits/Experience drop amount for every enemy in the game.
  - Buffed Smart Mouth's HP.
  - Buffed/Nerfed the drop rates of certain items.
  - Nerfed the selling price of Green Gel and Blue Gel.
  - Buffed the selling price of Rat Fur.
 
The purpose of these nerfs and buffs is to make the game just a bit more challenging, since it's unfair if you can level up super quickly and get healing items from enemies as fast as you lose the health they heal. Sorry, was that a bit confusing? It's just balancing, don't worry about it.

We are aware of an issue with your companions following behind you and getting stuck in doors. This will be fixed in the next release.

**Stable Level: Level 4**

<br><br>

# Alpha 8.1 (7/6/2018)
- Fixed a bug that's complicated to explain. Something about Traveler Swords and Training Vestments and a certain cutscene.

**Stable Level: Level 4**

<br><br>

# Alpha 8: The Update That Took A Long Time To Make But Adds A Boatload Of Content To The Game Making The Experience Even Better!™ (7/6/2018)
This is it: we've finally moved on to the third sector of Adon! We're making steady, good progress here. Soon enough, we'll get our own little boat and be off to the mainland! There's quite a few things in this changelog, so get ready for reading. Oh yeah, and I didn't elaborate on a few things, just because I wanted there to be an element of surprise...

Also, sorry for the huge wait between updates. A combination of lots of real-life stuff and some boredom prevented me from working on the game much. After I get back from my vacation, I'll be sure to dish out more updates as fast as I can! I also apologize for the fact that your save will not work anymore. You'll need to start the game from the beginning again... sorry! Hey, but at least you get to see all the changes we've made to earlier parts of the game.

I'd also like to give a shoutout to my fellow developer Brendan. He spent the morning of June 3rd, 2018 testing the entire game for bugs, from start to finish. That takes some dedication!

Ah yes, the changelog. It's still pretty boring, which has remained consistent throughout the game development:

### Additions:
- We've added in a new class: the Cleric! Clerics call upon their holy power to heal their allies. Where will this be applied? Just keep playing...
- There's 2 new enemies!
  - Smart Mouth: Remember the Big Mouth battle? It's time for a harder one...
  - Giant Rat: It's just a big, smelly rat. There's nothing too special... but it does drop special rations. It can be encountered in...
- The Dark Forest! This is one of FOUR new maps!
  - Dark Forest: It's just a dark forest. More will be explained in-game.
  - Campsite: It's just a campsite. Are you starting to see a pattern here?
  - There's also two tents. Why two, you ask? You'll see...
- There's generally a lot of new plot stuff in the game now. New sector, new quests, new goal, new cutscene... new person?
- Added in two new skills! 
  - Scratch: It's currently only usable by the Giant Rat, but it will have some more applications later on.
  - Cure I: It's only usable by the Cleric. It heals one of your team members by a bit. Unlocked at Level 3.
- Added in 2 new items.
  - Ration (Rat Jerky)
  - Rat Fur
- There's a new quest: "A Fellow Traveler: Part I". To trigger the quest, you must first complete the other side quest "A Traveler's Sword". If you adventure around the Dark Forest, you should easily see where to start the quest.
- The game window's size can finally be changed! Press F6 to cycle between 3 window sizes, and press F5 to go fullscreen.
  - Full credit for the script goes to Zeus81.
- A noise will play upon scrolling to the next textbox.
  - Full credit for the script goes to Eblo (Vincent in some places).
- Autosaves. I don't need to explain this.
  - I've put the autosaves where they need to be, and I've adjusted the tutorial and Mini Green Slime battle accordingly.
  - Note that the autosave slot is File 1, and any saves in there will be overwritten by the game's autosaves. This is mentioned in the tutorial, but I'm reiterating it here.
- Upon an attempt to run into someone's house, you'll get a little notice saying that it's a bad idea. The red-haired guy's house (remember the side quest "A Traveler's Sword"?) has its own special warning. Don't bother to head back through Green Slime Cavern and stuff, though. It's not worth it.
- You'll now get a notice upon an attempt to enter a Verdin Village Inn Shop before you really should be browsing stuff.
  - On a side note, the shopkeepers won't appear before Player 2 joins your team.

### Changes:
- Completely overhauled the interior of the Hermit's house. Now the inside of the house matches the shape of the outside!
- With an overhaul of someone's house, there has to be an overhaul of events! The hiding from the Hermit cutscene is now different as well. Nothing so special that you have to start over the game, though.
- Hey, we now have a cooler looking game icon! This is technically a change, since we changed the old game icon.
- The tutorial map has been completely redone. Hey, since you need a new save, you'll get to see it!
- I've messed around with the ordering of the files once again. I'm sure that you can figure it out.
  - I almost forgot to mention (just kidding, this was planned): you also can't see the core game files. I know that the chance of an alpha tester stealing the game is low, but you can never be too careful. Besides, what if another person (a non-tester) got ahold of the game?
- The Realm of Memory is now just called "Memory", because to be honest, how the hell did we get to a Realm of Memory?? You can refer to this first memory as "Player 2's Story".
- I changed the parallax background in Player 2's Story (in this case the mountain sunset) to a sunset without mountains "bc it looks like shit tbh".
- The hidden chest by the Hermit of the Woodland's house has been moved. Good luck finding it...
- Every enemy in the game was rebalanced.
- I've redone all the character sheets in the game files to save space by combining similar characters onto one sheet. I am an MS Paint god!
  - Then again, it is MS Paint. If there are any errors with the textures, please notify me.
- The Inn in Verdin Village now actually looks like it has two floors.
- Bushes now actually act like bushes, ergo you can walk through them.
- You can now only heal from the small spring in the Forest Clearing once. It was too OP. It's a long story.
- Hey, I found out how to mess around with the game code! I'm smart, yay! I changed some more of the in-game terms so that they're more appealing.
- While digging around in the code, I also figured out how to change the maximum amount of save files. There are now 6 available save slots.
- Blue Slimes now drop Water Bottles instead of Small Potions, with an increased chance. Small Elixirs also have a lower drop chance.
- Changed the icon of the Map of Adon.
- Decreased the critical hit chances for each class.

### Bug Fixes:
- I just realized that for a while now the player level is set to level 2 upon making a new save. It's 50 exp, if you really feel like abusing it, but if you want to honestly play the game, don't abuse it. It's that simple!
- Oh, it looks like only one of the exit tiles for Green Slime Cavern actually worked. Well, now all three do!
- Fixed a grammatical error with the Apprentice Robes' description.
- Fixed a bug where Blue Gel would glow slightly in your inventory.
- Fixed a bug where upon re-entering the Forest Clearing after fighting the Blue Slimes for the first time, but before getting Player 1 back, you'd be stuck with no way to get out.
- Fixed a spelling error where the sign in Green Slime Cavern would instruct you to have "propering adventuring gear".
- Fixed a spacing error with the Apprentice Robes' description.

Oh, and another thing: we're scrapping Stable Saves. What we're doing instead is making a "Stable Level"! This is the highest level any of your party members can be without risking not ever being able to learn a certain skill. It's complicated, but just trust me on this.

**Stable Level: Level 4**

<br><br>

# Alpha 7.1 (6/1/2018)
Summer is here, and it's time for more updates! This is just some more minor bug fixes and a change, but do not fret - Alpha 8 is on its way!

Now for those minor bug fixes and a change:

### Changes:
- Buffed the MHP and DEF of the Blue Slime.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the Hermit of the Woodlands would still be upstairs finding his little trinket if you were to return to the mentioned second floor.
- Fixed a typo when Player 2 apologizes to the Hermit of the Woodlands and the Hermit says that "the the forest is slowly disappearing."

<br><br>

# Alpha 7 (5/28/2018)
Yes, it is finally here. After 13 long, long hours of work (I'm not kidding), the new update is finally here... Alpha 7! While it may not have too much content in terms of time (7-9 minutes, I believe), it's some quality gameplay, and it even has a moral! I'm not going to spoil too much in this changelog, so you better play through the update...

Now for the aforementioned changelog:

### Gameplay Additions:
- Five new maps: the Forest House, its two floors, a Forest Clearing, and a Small Spring.
- There's two new important characters! You'll just have to play the game to see. I don't want to spoil you!
- Some cool plot has been added in, including a new quest! There's even some new control you get to exert...

### Battling Additions:
- Added in a new enemy: the Blue Slime! It drops Blue Gel. Who would have thought?
  - Slimes are pretty sticky, they may drop some extra items they've picked up...
  - The Blue Slime was very hard to make in terms of stats. If they need to balanced, whether made easier or harder, please tell me! The stats are one of the most important parts of an RPG.
- The battling system is now much more engaging. Different weapons now have their own attack animations! Also, enemies can use different skills than the default attack. While I knew this was a feature before, there was never really a need to incorporate it until now... this could make things interesting!

### Other Additions:
- There's a new "?" texture for unknown characters. Its only application so far is right at the beginning when the Village Headman's helper calls for you... if anyone remembers any others, make sure to tell me!
  - Well, there's another application for it in this release... you'll just have to play to see!
- There's two new chests in the world! One is in one of the new maps, while the other is not accessible yet... Chests like these will be either hard to find, or hard to get to, but whatever they are, the loot will (most likely) be worth it. Take the time to get these!

### Changes:
- Renamed the quest "Journey To The Bottom Of Adon" to "The Second Sector", and changed Player 2's dialogue accordingly.
- Improved the graphics for the Slime and Mini Slime.
- Double Slash and Fire I won't always succeed...
- Scaled down the volume of a lot of music/sounds.
- Made the Forest Arena look cooler.
- Changed couple in-game terms (basically what something is referred to). You won't see them unless you heal or something.
- Changed the bridge texture.
- Scaled down the door opening sound that's right at the start of the prologue. This will be the new default door open sound from a distance. Ok, that might be a bit too specific to be a "default"...

I think that's it! No bug fixes this time around, Alphas 6.1-6.4 took care of that. Like I said before: not much time included, but it's fun time. And as we continue to progress down Adon, we will get more and more experience (as in game-making experience, not leveling experience). Therefore, the updates will have higher quality, and will start coming in faster... have a great day, everyone!

<br><br>

# Alpha 6.4 (5/27/2018)
- Fixed a bug where you could walk on the walls of Green Slime Cavern.
- Fixed a bug where the Village Headman would still say the battle was 100 years ago, instead of 1000.
- Made the choices for the Village Headman's helper getting out of your way more flavorful.

<br><br>

# Alpha 6.3 (5/27/2018)
 - Fixed a bug where you couldn't equip the Floppy Hat.

<br><br>

# Alpha 6.2 (5/26/2018)
Let's just say playing through the game yourself as the programmer is helpful.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a couple errors with the Village Headman's dialogue, such as where he'd as you to "pick a flowers".
- I realized that technically, the "an" in "Legally An Errand" should be lowercase.
- Fixed a lot of occurrences of a character turning and the dialogue boxes not transitioning smoothly.
  - The Village Headman's dialogue is one case of this happening.
  - Another case is where Four-Toed Kevin turns to Big Mouth ("Big Mouth, go get 'em!").
  - There's even a case when Player 2 turns to Player 1.
- Fixed a bug where if you got sent back to the Village Headman's equipment crates due to not opening them, the map name would show.
- Fixed a bug where the Equipment tutorial tip doesn't make the screen fadeout, not to mention other out-of-order things.
- Made the yes/no text for the Solus Town/Verdin Village General Stores more flavorful.
- "If there were any". Don't ask.

Also, does anyone know how to put together 40-minute-long clips for a YouTube video without waiting 2147483647 hours? DM me if you have a solution.

<br><br>

# Alpha 6.1 (5/26/2018)
I remembered a few things that I had to do.

### Additions:
- Added in a tutorial tip for side quests after you accept "A Traveler's Sword". It's nothing too important, just in case you missed it.

### Changes:
- Made it so Double Slash's damage varies more.
- Made it so Fire I's damage varies less.

## Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where a certain white flower couldn't be picked in the Cave Entrance.

**Stable Save: once again, there really isn't a game breaking point, but you'll be forced to stop playing after Green Slime Cavern**

<br><br>

# Alpha 6 (5/26/2018)
Remember those announcements that said this would be Alpha 5.1? WRONG! There are way more features than I thought there would be, so here we are, another major update!

Of course, it wouldn't be a major update without a major huge changelog. Time for reading:

### Additions:
- There's 2 new skills!
  - "Double Slash", learned by the Warrior class at level 3.
  - "Fire I", learned by the Mage class at level 3.

### Changes:
- The Copper Sword is now actually worth something... and it's quite a bit!
- Woohoo, the red-haired guy and cows finally have face graphics.
- I messed around with the Green Slime's stats *a lot*/
  - Buffed the Green Slime's attack stat.
  - Nerfed the Green Slime's gold drop (8B).
  - Nerfed the Green Slime's EXP drop (12EXP).
  - Nerfed the Green Slime's spawn rate.

### Bug Fixes:
- Whoops! I was testing some stuff in Verdin Village, so I changed a tile on the path. I didn't change it back, though! Don't worry, the path is back to normal now.
- Now you actually receive the tent. Heheh.
- Fixed a bug where you'd have to press Space to leave Verdin Village after talking to Player 2 about the journey.
- Fixed a bug where after completing "A Traveler's Sword", the screen would fade to black and stay that way.
- Fixed another bug with "A Traveler's Sword" where the New Quest! pop-up looks weird.

**Stable Save: once again, there really isn't a game breaking point, but you'll be forced to stop playing after Green Slime Cavern**

<br><br>

# Alpha 5 (5/26/2018)
Updates are streaming in fast! Time for some real battling! Oh yeah, and another barrier, like the one from Pre-Alpha 1. Ah, the old days... let's get straight to the changelog!

Here it is, in all its wordy glory:

### Additions:
- There's 2 new maps! The "Cave Entrance" and "Green Slime Cavern". Player 2 will instruct you on how to get to them. Proceed with caution!
  - In the Cave Entrance, there's also some new flowers for you to pick. Yay, money! (well, Bits, to be exact)
  - Sorry if Green Slime Cavern is too easy/difficult, I didn't have much time to test it. Please report to me your experience in it.
- Added in 2 new items.
  - Tent
  - Copper Sword
- Added in a new enemy: the Green Slime! They can be encountered in Green Slime Cavern. They usually appear by themselves, but they may appear in a group of 2. Be careful!
- Verdin Village now has a population! There's a dog, two cows, and a guy that looks eerily like the Village Headman's helper. So one person.
  - Yes, yes, the cows have the face of a dog. Just keep reading, you'll see why.
- There's a new side quest: "A Traveler's Sword"! Talk to the guy pacing in the bottom-right of Verdin Village to initiate the quest.
  - Yes, I know the hair colors don't match. I'm running low on time. Any graphical errors will be fixed in Alpha 5.1.
  - Also note that I didn't test this part of the new update. It may be buggy. Please report any bugs!

### Changes:
- Messed with a couple already-made maps to make transfers look better.

I wouldn't grind in Green Slime Cavern just yet. Skills have yet to be added into the game, so leveling beyond the required level for a skill before it's added into the game may have disastrous consequences! The skills themselves shouldn't be too hard to add into the game - they may even come in a minor update! Alpha 5.1, here we come!

**Stable Save: once again, there really isn't a game breaking point, but you'll be forced to stop playing after Green Slime Cavern**

<br><br>

# Alpha 4.1 (5/22/2018)
Time for more bug fixes! There's no real additions in this update, just smoothing the game out once more. Remember, Alpha 5 is just around the corner, and with it will come some real adventuring! Finally, what everyone's been waiting for since the Pre-Release!

### Bug Fixes:
- Larry's table looked really weird, so I changed it. There's more to it than that, but that's pretty much what happened.
- Fixed a bug where upon entering Matilda's Magical Warehouse again, you'd be sucked into the dialogue once more, resulting in the game freezing (thanks @loser for finding it).
- Fixed a bug where you'd have to press space when you entered Matilda's Magical Warehouse, depending on certain conditions. The conditions don't matter anymore, because the bug is fixed (thanks @ApocalypseGamer1 for finding it).
- Fixed a pretty funny glitch where inside the Inn, you could basically climb on the store signs and get on the ceiling. Thanks @ApocalypseGamer1 for finding the glitch and dubbing it the "Spiderman"!

These are just a few of the many bugs that are lying (or is it laying?) around the game. Remember, your job as a tester is to find these bugs and report them to me. Recently the only bug reports I've gotten have been from my fellow developers. Try to contribute!

On a side note, I've decided to include the changelog in every game download, even if it can fit the limit of 2000 words. I'm not sure why, maybe it'll be useful if you want an offline reference?

**Stable Save: there isn't really a point where the game saves will get buggy in this version, but the stopping point is when you tell your teammate you're all prepared. Don't worry, you won't lose your save by accident this time! cough cough @an ok artist**

<br><br>

# Alpha 4: LOST CHANGELOG

<br><br>

# Alpha 3.1 (5/19/2018)
Wow, this next update came fast! Haha, no, this is a minor update. Just some bug fixes, and another thing: I forgot to add the Quest Log to the last version!

Bug Fixes:
- I was pressed for time, so I made a few typos in Alpha 3. Time to fix them here!
  - Fixed error grammar where teammate your says an amazing "women" Matilda is, but supposed to be it "woman".
  - Fixhedd a speelling erorr were ur temate says "woud" insted uv "would".

**Stable Save: right before you talk to your second party member regarding the completion of his missions...
you can still go ahead with talking to him as long as you have saved before doing so!**

<br><br>

# Alpha 3: The Update That Added Doors!™ (5/19/2018)
Oh baby, it's what you've all been waiting for: Alpha 3! This month-long project took a lot of work and dedication, but after all your waiting (and 3 sneak peaks), it's finally here!

Wow that was a lot of exclamation points.

You're going to have to play the update to understand just how good it is. If anything is confusing or could be better, feel free to ping me in #suggestions! The game needs to be as good as possible! And once again, thank you so much for testing the game. Without you testers, we may not have been able to reach this part, at least not as good as it is now!

### Additions:
- Added doors to the insides of both inns. There will be doors in future inns as well.
- Added a welcoming sign in Verdin Village.
- Added in a couple new items:
  - Small Elixir
  - Traveler Wand
- There's more additions further down below... just keep reading!

### Changes:
- The Village Headman's dialogue has been changed yet again, and this time even his move route. Who would have thought?
  - The Village Headman is a little unsure if you can defeat Apocalypse, but he believes in you.
  - Finding that rare item is now a quest called "A Rare Find".
  - The great war against Apocalypse 100 years back is now *1000* years back. That's a long time!
- Chapter 1 ("Blazing A New Trail") is now called "Into Verdin" (yes, like the quest).
- Changed the title screen back to what it was before (I just wasn't digging that night sky).
- Churches now have statues instead of crosses, because as this is a video game, religion most likely didn't develop the same way as it did in our world, therefore *not* resulting in Christianity.
  - Now what could the statue mean... that's coming in a *much* later update!
- Some small changes were made to the default attack.
  - Attack damage will vary a little less.
  - The minimum amount of damage an attack can deal is 1.
- Edited the Solus Town General Store a teensy bit.
- Some of the game's music was adjusted in terms of volume.
- Changed the name of the "Traveler's Sword" to "Traveler Sword".
- Fixed the Squire Sword tooltip.
- Your second team member is a little damaged at the beginning of the battle with Big Mouth. He did get beaten up, after all!
- Lowered Big Mouth's stats a bit.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed some bugs I can't remember. All that matters is that they're gone.

### Those Other Additions I Mentioned Earlier:
- You can now get your second party member!
- There's a nice tour of Verdin Village. Prepare for more usable things in future updates!
- Some nice plot has been added in.
- You can finish "Bandito Control", and there's a new quest as well!
- The shops in the Verdin Village inn have been mapped. However, you can't get in them yet. They'll be fixed up in a future update!

Oh yeah, and even though it doesn't show, we're technically in Chapter 2 now. No biggie.

**Stable Save: right before you talk to your second party member regarding the completion of his missions...
you can still go ahead with talking to him as long as you have saved before doing so!**

<br><br>

# Alpha 2.4 (4/21/2018)
Forgot to put the player back at the tutorial, heh.

...

~~(why did it take a week for someone to notice?)~~

**Stable Save: right before the Bandito cutscene**

<br><br>

# Alpha 2.3 (4/14/2018)
Sorry again for the lack of a big update! I've been busy and haven't had much time to work on big features. Don't worry - once I have time, I'll get right on it. There are just a couple actual things in this update, but there is a concept: stable saving! Check it out in #save-transferring!

Now for the stuff:
- Fixed a ton of stuff with the Village Headman. Hopefully everything with him is sorted out now...
- Fixed a bug with the music during the Bandito cutscene, alongside a couple other things.

That's it for now.

**Stable Save: right before the Bandito cutscene**

<br><br>

# Alpha 2.2 (4/8/2018)
It's been a while since the last release, and we've got some old bugs to fix! @an ok artist went back to Solus Town and found these bugs. Now let's see...

- Fixed a bug with the Village Headman's move route post-prologue.
- Fixed a bug with the Equipment tutorial tip.
- Fixed a bug where after obtaining the Squire set, you had to press Space to go downstairs in the Village Headman's house.

Apologies that this couldn't be a major update. With school starting again and stuff, me and the other developers have been busy. I've been occupied this weekend as well, and the only reason this update is out is because I had a few minutes to spare. Sorry for the delays - updates will be worked on more in the near future!

<br><br>

# Alpha 2.1 (4/1/2018)
Oof! I had some major errors I overlooked in Alpha 2. Let's see what I screwed up this time:

- Fixed a game-breaking bug where the game would freeze in the middle of the Bandito cutscene (thanks @Snooper Dragongem).
- Fixed a bug where you started the game with the Squire Armor and Squire Sword equipped.
- Fixed some mistakes with the Bandito dialogues.

On the other hand...
- Added in some sick music for the Bandito scene.

This is probably the official final update of our fast update phase. Once again, thanks for helping to test *The Trail* - you'll have more work cut out for you later, you'll see.

<br><br>

# Alpha 2 (4/1/2018)
This is the real update. Get April Fooled 😝.

Anyways... this is a real ***t h i c c*** update. There is some good stuff, so I won't spoil it in the changelog. That is why it is so small.

Another thing - today is the last day of spring break for me and my friends! These two weeks were fun away from the game and working on the game. We got so much progress done, so I just hope that we'll have time later on.

Time for that small changelog I was talking about:

## Additions:
- People now walk around Solus Town. Now the town has more than 4 residents.
- A really awesome battle cutscene in Verdin Village, where you meet a rival group that you'll meet again later on, and a new party member!
  - Note that after the cutscene, the party member will disappear, and the group won't be there either. This is because I don't have enough time today to finish all of Verdin Village. So just put down the game after you finish the cutscene.
- I did a ton of math and stat balancing, because the battle system was a little weird. Now my head hurts.
- We have a cool new title screen.

@a decent conceptualizer and I have thought up some awesome stuff for Verdin Village. Have patience - while the updates won't come as quickly now, they will still come! And now that we've gotten on the road to a great storyline, the possibilities are nearly endless...

Oh, and Happy Easter to you who are celebrating it today!

<br><br>

# Alpha 1.4 (3/30/2018)
Again, just a couple little thingies I had to do before I forgot them.

- Fixed a bug where after you've defeated the Mini Green Slime and exit Solus Town again, the map would still scroll to the Forest Arena, when there's nothing to do there (found by @Snooper Dragongem).
- Going to Verdin Village is now considered a quest ("Into Verdin").

Like I've said before, Verdin Village is coming soon, with a lot of new mechanics!

<br><br>

# Alpha 1.3 (3/30/2018)
Nothing too major in this update except for one thing: __we've officially moved out of cheat mode!__

That means that the chest with the map is gone, the vehicles are gone, and most things are gone that give you an unfair advantage. If you notice anything that looks like it shouldn't be there, make sure to point it out to me.

And one more thing - you're gonna' need to make a new save. I'm not sure how badly the game will bug with this update, but stuff will start to be weird later on. So make that new save!

If you're one of our new Alpha Testers, then great! This will help you ease into the game without any weird stuff going on.

<br><br>

# Alpha 1.2 (3/30/2018)
A few little thingies I thought of randomly.

### Bug Fixes:
- When finding the Old Key, it still said "Village Headman's Key was found!"
- There were some bugs with the Forest Arena battle cutscene.

### Changes:
- A few things were made better with the battle cutscene as well.
- Progressing to a new chapter is now cooler.
- Traveler equipment now sells for 5 Bits each. So a little more than a flower.

Don't worry, some bigger updates are coming soon! Well, I hope some bigger updates are coming soon...

<br><br>

# Alpha 1.1 (3/29/2018)
A couple quick little fixes and an announcement:
If you already have a Map of Adon, don't open that chest next to Solus Town! You'll get another map! - well, that's not much of a problem, but if you want that perfect, perfect run, don't open the chest!

### Changes:
- The Village Headman's Key is now called Old Key.
- The Village Headman's dialogue was changed a little.

<br><br>

# Alpha 1 (3/29/2018)
This is it, baby! Alpha is finally here! Now you are eligible for the @Alpha Tester role!

There's a lot of stuff to cover, so I'm going to get right to the changelog:

### Additions:
- I wasn't lying when I said you'll get battles in Alpha. You can now fight the Mini Green Slime! Just proceed onwards with the game and you will find it normally in the Forest Arena.
- Save transferring is now available! I've elaborated on it in #save-transferring, so if you have an old save, be sure to check it out!

### Changes:
- We've been sticking with the developer sprite (me) for some time. However, we now have a real character sprite! Make sure to leave your feedback about how he looks.
- Changed a few things in the prologue to make your gameplay experience better, notably obtaining a Map of Adon, the continent you are on. If you transferred a save from a older version AFTER advancing to Chapter 1, you will not have this map. A chest will be next to Solus Town (ONLY IN THIS VERSION) so you can get the map.
- Changed a few tile mechanics.
- Vehicles have been removed for now. No more free exploring, this is real gameplay now!

### Planned Updates:
- If you're hyped for another town, stay tuned for more updates, for Verdin Village has been confirmed! The tiles are on the map, but you can't actually do anything yet.
- There will be a cave later on where you can fight more enemies and actually level up for once.

Now it's super important that we get bug fixes and suggestions. If you see anything that needs fixing or could be made better, make sure to send me (@a really good programmer) a DM.

We're already working on Alpha 2, so make sure to keep your eyes open for it! Thanks for testing *The Trail*!

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 4.2 (3/27/2018)
- Changed a couple things with the Village Headman's dialogue.

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 4.1 (3/27/2018)
Some quick fixes from Pre-Alpha 4.

### Additions:
- Added a Tutorial Tip about Equipment.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a non-visible bug with going down the stairs in the Village Headman's House.
- Fixed 3 bugs with the Village Elder's dialogue.
- Fixed a bug with selling flowers.

### Changes:
- Changed the flavor text for all 3 flowers.
- Changed the flavor text for Squire Armor.

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 4 (3/27/2018)
We're heading into Chapter 1, baby! Next big release should be Alpha!

### Additions:
- You get a nice little sound effect when you complete a quest! Note that I actually added this in last release but forgot to write it down...
- The Village Headman has you go searching for a crate. Yay, sounds like fun again...
- Added 5 new items.
  - Water Bottle
  - Small Potion
  - Traveler's Sword
  - Squire Sword
  - Squire Armor

### Bug Fixes:
- Whatever came up as I was working. There's still probably a lot of bugs, though!

### Changes:
- Made the inn system a little nicer.
- Once you finish the Prologue, you can explore again!
  - **NOTE: This will be the last major update where you can explore the world freely!**
- Made a couple things from previous updates better.

### Planned Updates:
- I'm also going to start making special "bug fixing" versions of the game that make it easier to make progress. This way, bugs will be easier to find without messing around with stuff that's already good.

The game is coming along very nicely. I'm glad with the progress, and I think I've finally gotten the full hang of the software. Alpha 1 should come out in the next couple of days!

Oh, and I forgot to mention, there's some juicy plot in this update... not going to spoil it for you, though!

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 3 (3/26/2018)
This release may look small, but it's full of more content! The Village Headman will continue in giving you your trials. The last one will be added in soon, with a lot of dialogue... Anyways, I think I made a mistake in not making the changelog as I made the update. I'll make sure to be more vigilant next time.

Now it's the classic boring changelog, with me trying to make it as interesting as I can:

### Additions:
- Now you can go shopping for the Village Headman. Yay, fun... but at least it's an introduction to the shop system!

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed some bugs I can't be bothered to remember.

### Changes:
- Your exploration possibilities are very limited now. You can't enter most buildings, and you can't exit Solus Town anymore. If you want to explore, try using an older version.
- No more barging into random people's houses! The two houses in the top right of Solus Town can no longer be entered.

I told you I probably forgot a lot of stuff, and the size of this changelog proves my point. So guys, make sure that you scan this release carefully for bugs. I'm counting on y'all to keep the game smooth!

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 2.3 (3/25/2018)
- Fixed a long-time bug that no one but @an ok artist noticed: upon re-entering your house, the Village Headman's helper would be in your way.

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 2.2 (3/24/2018)
Oh dear, our bug fixes have bugs now! Don't worry, @Snooper Dragongem found these out quickly, so you guys don't need to worry about them!

### Bug Fixes:
- The map overlapping glitch is finally fixed (I hope).
- The hot-air balloon was on the lava island instead of next to Solus Town (don't ask why).

That's hopefully the last bit of work I need to do today. I was busy eating and playing on my switch, and I kind of am exhausted.

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 2.1 (3/24/2018)
This is just little errors and such that have to be corrected. There's nothing too major in this update. These termites and nails, however, are paving the way to a great game. We're nearing the end of the prologue!

This time you're going to be reading a sort of mini-changelog. It's like one of those little model cars you can get, but more useful:

### Additions:
- The Village Headman now actually checks if you have the flowers. The quest now has a purpose.

### Changes:
- Speaking of the flowers, due to technical difficulties ~~and me being lazy~~, you only need to collect one of each flower type.
- The doors in Solus Town now look even prettier.
- The Village Headman's runner is now his helper.
  - If he traps you somewhere because you made a really stupid mistake, just ask him nicely and he'll get you out of wherever you are.
- I've switched the way that quests worked from switches to variables. Of course, this probably sounds like technical mumbo jumbo, but it's just a way of saving game space and making the game more efficient.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug in the Village Headman's dialogue (noticed by @Snooper Dragongem).
- Fixed a glitch (yes, an actual glitch) that y'all were bug-ging me (I'm so sorry) about near the large lava island where the maps would overlap incorrectly.

Now be patient. I was busy with science fair today from 5:30 AM to 4:30 PM, and the rest of the developers are out. More work will be done tomorrow!

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 2 (3/23/2018)
Time for a ~~relatively~~ big update! We've got a ~~nearly~~ legitimate quest and other cool stuff. 2.5 hours of work really pays off! This changelog is so big, in fact, that... actually, I think you're just going to have to read a lot. Yeah, I think that's it.

Time for the boring changelog again. Does anyone actually read these?:

### New Features:
- You can pick flowers! And not just when it's part of the quest! Flowers later on in the game will also be able to be picked.
- The Village Headman's runner will walk around his house and "clean" stuff.
- Oh yeah, that quest I was talking about. We'll get to that in a minute.

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where if you tried to go downstairs in your house more than twice, you'd have to use the action button instead of simply walking into the stairs.
- Fixed a bug where you couldn't read the signs in Solus Town.
- Fixed a bug where the name of a map wouldn't appear in the top left once you finished the tutorial.
- Fixed a bug where after you beat the tutorial, 'Home F2' is displayed in the top left of the screen too early.

### Changes:
- Made it so the tutorial map won't loop, because to be honest, it wasn't reaching the effect I was going for.
- The game now takes away your Tutorial Key after leaving the tutorial.
- Made some improvements in the overall tutorial.
  - You can set your name for now, but that might be changed later. Names that are too long end up cutting off dialogue. Try to stick to 6 characters for now!
- The airship has been changed from a blimp to a hot-air balloon.
- Scaled down the music in Solus Town; it was way too loud (noticed by @Solguana).

The Juicy Bit:
- The Village Headman has a mission for you!: pick some flowers.
  - It doesn't sound all that great, but more will come.
  - You actually don't need to pick the flowers to continue with his dialogue (yet). I'll add the requirements in later.
- That green-haired guy in the bottom left of your house? He talks!
- The Village Headman has lots of juicy dialogue.

I probably left some stuff out of this changelog. This has been our biggest update yet!

That's it for now. This update is prone to be filled with bugs, so keep an eye out! The Alpha is nearing - us developers will continue working to bring these updates to you! Thanks for playing The Trail!

<br><br>

# Pre-Alpha 1.1 (3/21/2018)
Those bugs that my fellow developers noticed have been fixed! Now here's yet another boring list of stuff:

### Bug Fixes:
- Fixed a bug where the text in the upstairs room of your house is repeated if the room is re-entered.
- Edited the tutorial to show the proper controls: arrow keys to move.

### Additions and Removing Stuff:
- Removed that barrier because it was stupid. Now you can explore the world again!
- More shallow water has been added. It's been 100% completed except for the huge body of land. I'll get to that soon.
- The lava island in the bottom right is inaccessible unless you have an airship.
- Speaking of airships, the vehicles will remain in their current location until the game moves out of "cheat mode".

### Planned Updates:
- That guy standing in the house doing nothing WILL do something later. Just wait.
- Like I said before, the shallow water will be completed in the near future.

That's pretty much it. Yeah. Have fun with our first bug fixes!

# Pre-Alpha 1 (3/21/2018)
Remember that first release right above this? That wasn't even a pre-alpha, more of a pre-pre-alpha. This is a real version of the game.

Now it's time for the usual boring changelog... maybe this one will be more interesting...?

### New Features:
- A tutorial has been added to the game, so now you can stop having an excuse for being a noob.
- A little incomplete cutscene happens once you get teleported to your house.
- You can't leave your house.
- Brendan has become unused (for now).

### Planned Updates:
- Being able to explore the world once again.
- Actually adding in real characters; the developer characters are just placeholders because I'm too lazy to think for once.
- Finishing up the cutscene and getting to the action.

### A Third Section:
- We've decided that the game will be divided into chapters. Now it's like a book, but more fun.
- We're accepting suggestions anyone has about the plot and items and stuff.
- Once the slime battle is reachable, the game will officially reach its Alpha phase.
- If you have enough time on your hands and like to dig around in files, you'll see a little secret with the characters...

So yeah. The game is really boring. I'll be working more from now on to bring more and better updates. And, of course, allowing you to actually have fun exploring again. Have patience, my friends - the game will start developing quickly and with quality!

# First Release (3/11/2018)
This is a very bare-bones game right now. It's essentially a sort of pre-alpha. Thanks to the fact that I'm using a game maker, it doesn't look as weak as you might think it would be in a pre-alpha (take *Minecraft* for example).

### Game Features:
- An essentially empty world that only has landscapes. You can explore it in the vehicles near where you start.
- SOME LOUD MUSIC (I plan on making original music later on, either by myself or with someone else).
- 4 classes - the Warrior, the Mage, the Cleric, and the Thief. Note that the Cleric and Thief currently are not usable in the game.
- Two (temporary!) party members: @a really good programmer (Warrior) and his friend @a decent conceptualizer (Mage). As the game continues to be developed, these characters will become unused and replaced by a group of adventurers. For the record, I have no ideas for their names or stories.
- The Warrior's stats are sorted out, but the Mage's are still yet to be changed from the default.
- A basic weapon and armor for each class, plus a traveler hat and clothing.
- Solus Town, the player's hometown. There's a shop that sells nothing, and a lot of empty houses. The village headman's house will be added soon (top left corner), and many features and quests will be available in this town and others.
- Speaking of other towns, Verdin Village, a small mountain town, is confirmed to be the next village. It is currently unreachable, and is empty of interaction. There's also a cave and cave entrance, which does have monsters in it.
- The only monster is a Green Slime. It is able to be fought; however, the map is unreachable (the cave mentioned earlier).
- Some other stuff I probably forgot.

This is a lot of stuff to start off a game. There will be a lot more releases, and a lot more features coming soon! Just be patient - the game will start to get ***really*** good (I hope). The testers will be the ones who help this game get so much better!
